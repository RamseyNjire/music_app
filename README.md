# Music Inventory App

This project involves all the major aspects of Rails, excluding testing. I built a music inventory app, where users can create accounts, set up bands, add albums with tracks, record notes on those tracks, and view the lyrics.

Below are some screenshots for demonstration:

The bands index page:

Viewing a single band:

In this project, I

- Implement some basic routes;
- Build models for users and art, as well as others, including a join table (artshares);
- Write migrations for those models to evolve the schema;
- Write DB- and model-level validations for certain attributes;
- Seed the database with some starter data;
- Create an API layer using different controllers to handle requests from the API endpoints;
- Use Postman to test each of the endpoints to make sure they are working properly;
- Use gitflow.

## Built With

- Ruby 2.5.0
- Ruby on Rails 5.2.6
- Postman 7.33.0

## Getting Started
- Clone the project to your local machine;
- `cd` into the project directory;
- Run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems;
- Run `rails db:create`;
- Run `rails db:migrate`;
- Run `rails s` to start a server in your computer;
- Run `rails routes` to see the available API endpoints (ignoring Rails generated routes, of course);
